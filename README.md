This repository contains a sample of my work throughout the years at Bossa Nova Data Solutions.

It includes some microservices scripts for our AI driven quality assurance platform Caperio.AI.

It also includes some projects we have done over the years in the credit risk management industry for developing various customized
predictive analytic solutions.

Sometimes there is a bug in github when trying to open a jupyter notebook file. If it doesn't open, please just click to reload and try again. Eventually, it opens.
